# ChessGUI

A quick Fabric Mod that displays banner based minecraft chess boards (Example for banner name: "White Queen", not case sensitive)

# Installation
Just add this mod and https://github.com/CottonMC/LibGui to your fabric mods folder and stuff should work.

# Usage
(using default keybinds, keybinds can be edited in controll settings)

Go to the lower left corner of the chessboard. If you play white that is a1, if you play black that is h8.
Face the middle of the board. Press `i`, then `From Pos` and then set the spacing accordingly. `B##B` where `#` is air and `B` is banner, is a spacing of 3. 

Press `O` to view the board.

`P` toggles marking changes in the UI. Only the last change is ever marked, so castling marks the rook if done right.
